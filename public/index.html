                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    An <strong>index</strong> homepage is very similar to a main or default page shown by the web server
                    when the <strong>HTTP</strong> client requests a <strong>URL</strong>. This page can be identified 
                    as <strong>INDEX.HTML</strong> on an Apache web server (OSU Engineering's server software) or 
                    <strong>DEFAULT.HTML</strong> on Microsoft's .NET server. Most <strong>GET</strong> requests 
                    for / will be mapped to the path /INDEX.HTML in the root directory, which leads to the web homepage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The network tab output screen from the Web Dev browser is showing status codes, port numbers, types,
                    favicons, and URLs. The file's <strong>request</strong> and <strong>response</strong> headers provide 
                    more information and details when viewed from the web server versus the local hard drive. For example, 
                    the response headers from the web server show connection, cache details, cookie, host, and user agent. 
                    They also include the status, method type (GET), header request data and header response data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The favicon.ico file showed the status of 200 because the request was successfully processed by the
                    server, and the response body had needed information.
                    Meanwhile, the MAIN.CSS and MAIN.JS files both showed the status of 404 (Not Found) because the
                    index
                    file only includes html contents.
                    Therefore, the web server cannot provide the requested resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The request URL for web file is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~hoangban/a1-hoangban/ and its
                    structure is <strong>scheme</strong>, <strong>subdomain</strong>, <strong>host domain</strong>, and 
                    <strong>resource</strong>, respectively.
                    The URL <strong>scheme</strong> is HTTPS, which is a secure hypertext transfer protocol that the web client must use
                    to request the resource.
                    The <strong>host domain</strong> or server name is oregonstate.edu, which is the website where the
                    resource is hosted and to which the request must be sent.
                    The section attached to the front of the domain name is called the <strong>subdomain</strong>, which
                    is web.engr.
                    Finally, the <strong>URL resource</strong> is /~hoangban/a1-hoangban/, which is the path name of the
                    web server that will be executed to provide the requested content.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Frontend design is the process of creating a friendly user interface and user experience of web
                    applications.
                    The purpose is to design the visual elements that users interact with, such as forms, buttons,
                    navigation, and overall layout.
                    Key requirements usually involve a consistent, color scheme, a photography, icon, and illustration
                    scheme.
                </p>
                <h4>The five "E"s of Usability in frontend design:</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Effective</strong></dt>
                    <dd>How users can complete their goals with a high degree of accuracy.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Efficient</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Speed is the main objective in efficiency.
                        An application is efficient if it helps users perform tasks with the least number of steps.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Easy to navigate</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        The ease of use in navigation is one of the most important requirements to consider.
                        Users should be able to understand the platform and locate their objectives quickly on the first
                        encounter.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Error-free</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Users may sometimes experience errors while trying to perform specific tasks.
                        Learning about users' common errors will prevent future accessibility and availability issues.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><strong>Engaging</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        The application should easily grasp the users' attention if it fits their unique needs.
                        They will be more likely to come back in the future if they find the product enjoyable and
                        gratifying to use.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    The <strong>header</strong> element represents the banner of a website, and it typically includes
                    introductory content such as the name, publisher, and marketing slogan.
                    Developers are encouraged to use minimal space for the header so that the content shows above the
                    scroll area in the viewport.

                    The <strong>nav</strong> or <strong>navigation</strong> element transitions users from the current
                    page to other pages.
                    There are different navigation sets such as search, tools, stories, locations, and legal links.

                    The <strong>main</strong> element consists of stories, galleries or tutorials that convey the
                    primary content of the application.

                    The <strong>section</strong> element is typically a generic standalone section within an
                    application.
                    It is used to create a grouping of related content.

                    The <strong>article</strong> element represents a single specific topic in a document.
                    Therefore, it is often used inside a section element with a second-level headline.

                    The <strong>aside</strong> element denotes content that is indirectly related to an article.
                    They are typically presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

                    The <strong>figure</strong> element is also presented similarly as aside, but also consists of an
                    image or movie, and the figcaption element provides the description for that media.

                    The <strong>blockquote</strong> element indicates that the quoted text of a paragraph is an extended
                    quotation.
                    It can be presented as a quote or a citation for the text.

                    The <strong>footer</strong> element is designed for contact information, legal information, links to
                    important sources and will typically be found below the main tag.

                    The <strong>div</strong> or <strong>division</strong> element is a generic placeholder for content
                    that has no effect or style.
                    It can be used to divide content when no other sensible options of element are left.
                </p>
                <h4>Hyperlinks with Anchors:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>anchor</strong> element creates hyperlinks that connect users from one page to
                        another. The href attribute will be used to indicate the specific path/URL to the 
                        <strong>external</strong> content that resides outside the current website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An ID attribute can be used with a hashtag to define the reference for an <strong>internal</strong> 
                        anchor and enable it to link from one text item to another within the same application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Navigation</strong> anchors act as decorative button-like anchors that can improve usability by assisting 
                        users move from page-to-page and to external websites.

                <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                <p>
                    There are six specifications for optimizing the images of a web application, which include
                    descriptive file name, small file size, exact dimensions, correct file format, reduced resolution,
                    and color mode. The file name should provide descriptions of the image in regard to who, what, or
                    where in order to optimize the search engine. The file sizes and dimensions play a big role in
                    impacting the load speed. Therefore, images should always be cropped, reduced, and compressed to
                    accommodate for faster load time. The correct file format also helps the image load correctly.
                    Online photos are typically JPG while logos and icons are usually GIF. The resolution for images
                    should be reduced to between 72 and 300+ pixels per inch for proper rendering process. Lastly, the
                    optimal color mode for PNG, JPG, SVG and WebP files should be RGB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Photos usually consist of high resolutions, great details and various colors. Therefore, the most
                    appropriate file formats are JPG and WebP since the photographic images need to be compressed to
                    reduce the load on the server. On the contrary, PNG, SVG and GIF formats are most suitable for
                    line art images. The alpha channel that comes with PNG files works best for biomorphic shapes and
                    solid colors. SVG format produces crisp images and text due to its mathematically-derived graphics.

                <h3>Favicons</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Favicons</strong> are logos or symbols that represent a company's web application when viewed on a browser
                    tab, a smartwatch or a cellphone. The symbol is first designed to work best with the resolution on
                    different devices. It is then saved in GIF, PNG, ICO and SVG formats for testing on various browsers. 
                    The browser will add the symbol anchor to a bookmark or search engine results list.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important aspects of front end design is to present the document elements properly 
                    on the web application. This is thanks to the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language that redefines 
                    the basic HTML semantic structure. Its main role is to describe how the contents should be rendered 
                    on webpages to improve usability, readability and legibility.
                </p>
                <h4>There are 5 ways to incorporate styles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An external file with a .css file extension will contain CSS rules for the HTML elements. That 
                        stylesheet file is then linked in the global area of the website, and all other pages can be 
                        styled as long as they are linked to that website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other than the global .css file, external stylesheets can also be imported in the global stylesheet 
                        for certain specific components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styles can be embedded directly in HTML files using a style tag. For instance, styling an h1 can 
                        be done by first giving it an attribute and value, and then wrapping the h1 within a style tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The attribute and value can also be used inline within an element tag like h1 to apply styles directly 
                        in the HTML files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, Document Object Model, or DOM, can be manipulated to incorporate styles within a JavaScript 
                        file.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="javascript">
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, the main types of data include <strong>number, Boolean, string, symbol, object,</strong> and 
                    <strong>special values</strong>. The only number type in JavaScript is a double-precision floating-point number. 
                    When an expected value is not a number, a special number value NaN will be returned instead. Similarly to most other 
                    programming languages, Boolean types are <strong>True</strong> and <strong>False</strong>. Strings that closely 
                    resemble lines of text are typically enclosed in either a single quote or double quote.
                    <strong>String Literals</strong> are strings that contain only characters, and <strong>Template Literals</strong> 
                    are strings that also include expressions. Objects are sets of name-value pairs, and their names represent their 
                    properties. An object's property can be <strong>created, read, updated</strong> and <strong>deleted</strong>. 
                    Finally, 2 special values <strong>undefined</strong> and <strong>null</strong> will be returned when the expected 
                    values are absent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 4 actions that can be performed on objects are Create, Read, Update and Delete, or also referred to as <strong>CRUD</strong>. 
                    Objects's properties can be created, read and updated by using the . operator on the variable. The delete operator can 
                    be used for deleting objects' properties. All property names can be returned by passing them to the Object.keys() method. 
                    Arrays in JavaScript must have properties in string data type. Therefore, the elements of an array can be accessed by
                    using square brackets to index them starting from 0. The method Array.isArray() can be used to check if the variable's 
                    value is an array or not. The push() method is used to add elements at the end of an array. The includes() method can 
                    be used to check if a value exists in an array or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>JSON</strong> is a widely used format that can allow programs to exchange data in different languages. There are 
                    2 main methods of implementing JSON and they are <strong>JSON.stringify()</strong> and <strong>JSON.parse()</strong>. 
                    JSON.stringify() can create a JSON string from a JavaScript object, and JSON.parse() can create an object from a JSON string.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to other programming languages, JavaScript also depends on <strong>conditionals</strong> and <strong>loops</strong> 
                    to make decisions. Conditionals are written using <strong>if</strong> and <strong>switch</strong> statements. The if statements 
                    will execute if the given code is equal to true. An if-then-else statement can also be used when there are several conditions. 
                    JavaScript conditions can contain any data type, and any non-Boolean value will be converted to a Boolean value as needed due 
                    to built-in automatic conversion. <strong>Equality</strong> operators are utilized to compare values in JavaScript. 
                    "Strict equality" operators === check if 2 operands are strictly equal, and !== can check if they are not strictly equal. 
                    There are also "loose equality" operators == and != that can check if 2 operands are or are not loosely equal. In addition, 
                    there are <strong>comparison</strong> operators <, <=, > and >= to further compare values. Operands on both sides must all be 
                    either string or number type for the operators to work properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2 primary loops in JavaScript are <strong>while</strong> and <strong>for</strong> loops. In a while loop, the written 
                    expression will continue to execute until the condition evaluates to false. On the other hand, the for loop has 3 different 
                    versions, which are <strong>for</strong> loop, <strong>for of</strong> loop and <strong>for in</strong> loop. The basic for loop
                    executes for each evaluation of the condition and also continues until the condition turns false. The for of loop traverses over 
                    an iterable value, such as a string or an array. In contrast, the for in loop is used to traverse over the properties of an object.

                    JavaScript is able to support <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> like several other high-level languages because their 
                    objects can contain their own <strong>identify, state</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong>. The main difference is objects in 
                    JavaScript can be created without declaring classes. <strong>Prototypes</strong> are special objects that can store one common 
                    property for multiple objects, which can be leveraged to create several objects with the same property.

                    Besides object-oriented programming, JavaScript can also utilize <strong>functional programming</strong>. JavaScript functions 
                    can be assigned to variables, receive other functions as arguments and return other functions due to their <strong>first-class</strong> 
                    nature. A function is referred to as a <strong>higher-order</strong> function when it receives another function as an argument. 
                    The map() function is an example of several built-in higher-order functions in JavaScript.
